# Domain Vision Statement

The domain model will represent cloud-based datasets and processes that a learner can follow
to interactively explore the meaning of and applications of these datasets.

The model will support training a learner in the use of and curation of a knowledge graph
in order to map out and visualize the meaning and potential applications of a collection of datasets.
The model will support training this learner in effective processes for semantic integration
and integrative analysis of cloud-based datasets.

The model will represent dataset registries and repositories to support training learners in
effective search and retrieval of information resources,
with a focus on semantic artifacts, datasets, and analysis software.

The model will also represent individual researchers, research activities, research instruments,
and research communications in order to train a learner to construct and enrich a knowledge graph
with the goal of supporting effective integration of and reuse of datasets.

Finally, the model will represent resources relevant to a training process such as notebooks, servers,
modules, instructors, workshops, lessons, and learners,
to support instructors in authoring lessons and conducting workshops.

## About

A <span class="term">Domain Vision Statement</span>[^1] is a short description (about one page)
of the <span class="term">core domain</span> and the value it will bring, the "value proposition."
Ignore those aspects that do not distinguish this domain model from others.
Show how the domain model serves and balances diverse interests.
Keep it narrow.
Write this statement early and revise it as you gain new insight.

It should be usable directly by the management and technical staff during all phases of development
to guide resource allocation, to guide modeling choices, and to educate team members.
