Seeking usability feedback on pre-alpha [^1] heliophysics-focused lesson materials to advance open-science literacy and capacity-building.

Target audience: those who do research relevant to NASA's five Science Mission Directorate (SMD) divisions -- Earth Science, Planetary Science, Heliophysics, Astrophysics, and Biological and Physical Sciences -- from undergraduate students through established scientists and managers.

Ideally, you will already be familiar with:

- a discipline relevant to NASA's SMD -- ideally heliophysics, but not required
- general open-science concepts (e.g. by completing NASA's Open Science 101 online course [^2], or equivalent experience)
- use of the Python programming language, via the Jupyter notebook interface (e.g. by completing a Python-based Carpentries workshop [^3], or equivalent experience)

Logistics:

- 30-minute slots Mon Feb 19 (yes, this is indeed a US federal holiday) through Fri Feb 23 at starting times of 9am, 9:30am, 10am, 2pm, 2:30pm, and 3pm (US Eastern Time, i.e. -05:00 offset from UTC)
- you will receive $50 USD for your time
- session will be over Zoom. In-person option in New York City (Hamilton Heights) -- indicate via email if this is of interest (intended for NYC locals, i.e. no travel stipend).
- email [topst-helio@polyneme.xyz](mailto:topst-helio@polyneme.xyz) with
  - at least three (3) slots that could work for you (you may indicate preferences)
  - your career stage / role (can choose more than one): student, researcher, manager
  - your country of residence; if in USA, also your state/territory of residence.
